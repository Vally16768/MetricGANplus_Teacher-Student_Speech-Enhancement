# Project control index

This directory is the canonical control plane for the research project.

| Register | Purpose | Read when |
|---|---|---|
| [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) | Current system blocks, interfaces, evidence and source map | model, pipeline or config work |
| [DATA.md](DATA.md) | Dataset contract, split policy and read-only boundary | any data or training work |
| [EXPERIMENTS.md](EXPERIMENTS.md) | Run lifecycle, registry and promotion state | experiments, metrics, models |
| [VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md) | Test matrix and required gates | every code/config change |
| [DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md](DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md) | Status and ownership of every canonical document | documentation or article work |
| [ACADEMIC.md](ACADEMIC.md) | Evidence language, reporting and article-ready outputs | claims, reports, publication |
| [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) | Decisions and their causes | before changing project policy |
| [TODO.md](TODO.md) | Ordered cleanup/implementation/experiment gates | every active campaign task |
| [EXECUTION_TODO.md](EXECUTION_TODO.md) | Completed P1–P6 execution board, dependencies and evidence | historical baseline/T1 audit |
| [TEACHER_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md](TEACHER_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md) | Executed calibration-first T1 protocol and separate future TTS-transfer boundary | T1 audit or future successor design |
| [TEACHER_SUCCESSOR_PLAN.md](TEACHER_SUCCESSOR_PLAN.md) | Predeclared T2 method for discriminator fidelity, controlled teacher improvement and gated student transfer | all T2 design or implementation work |
| [TEACHER_SUCCESSOR_TODO.md](TEACHER_SUCCESSOR_TODO.md) | Active T2 dependency board, gates, evidence and next action | start and end of every T2 iteration |

Current release state: **the corrected true-length S0 baseline v2 is promoted
and canonical. S0-WB selected epoch 34/stop 42 and S0-NB selected 41/49. The
strict current-output T1 calibration failed after its one permitted retry, so
there is no T1, C1 or S1 result. T2 is planned but no T2 training has
started**.

Open work:

- T2.1 must establish exact official discriminator parity before D fitting;
- D2 must pass both scalar calibration and local directional gates before any
  teacher update;
- the TTS metric-critic hypothesis remains a separate future campaign.
